
SASS files used are:

nesting -  to create CSS rules
variable
mixin - define styles that can be re-used throughout the stylesheet
function- lighten()
placeholder selector- #about, #contact

The main html page is index.html
There are different web pages for foods menu and drinks menu.
For the foods menu, the sass files are used. For the drinks, I hav used a table to display the drinks menu.

On the main page, I have used header, footer and various buttons to view drinkd and foods menu.
